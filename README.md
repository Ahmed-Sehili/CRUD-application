# This is a basic CRUD application made as my first backend project

It uses Javascript + Node.js to connect to an sqlite3 database to create, read, update and delete users by exposing API endpoints.

It's a very, very simple project which I had made for getting my hands dirty with some API development, I promise to deliver better and bigger projects afterwards, so stay tuned.
